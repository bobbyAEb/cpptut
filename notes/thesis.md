Review

• What problem(s) are they solving? Why are these problems important?
• What did they really do? (as opposed to what the authors say or imply they did) 
• What methods are they using?
• What is the contribution of the work? (i.e. what is interesting or new to the field?) 

• Would you have solved the problem differently? 
• Do all the pieces of their work fit together logically?
• What were the results? Did they do what they set out to do?

关于摘要，他说他心中的标准摘要应该有五句，第一句是论文在文献里的定位，第二句是这篇文章做什么，第三句是为什么做，第四句是发现了什么，第五句是这些发现有什么意义。然后这五句其实各自对应文章的一部分，第一句是引言，第二句是研究设计，第三句是待检验假设或文献讨论，第四句是研究结果，第五句是结论。也就是说，摘要每一句话都是正文一个部分的总结。
核心就是回答你为什么要读这篇论文。所以对应着:S1因为important，S2因为solid，S3因为capable (of filling in the gap)，S4因为interesting，S5因为influential
